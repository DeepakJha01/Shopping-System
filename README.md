# SHOPPING SYSTEM (ELECTROSTOP)
Now a days the life style of the people are changing. People feel uncomfortable and time consuming to go to crowded markets. So, E-Shopping is a boon as it saves lot of time.  Online shopping is a process whereby consumers directly buy goods, services etc. from a seller without   an intermediary service, over  the Internet.
